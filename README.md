# About Me
## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on earning an Associate in Applied Science in Web/UX from Wake Technical Community College (anticipated May 2026).
- ðŸŽ“ I graduated from Wake Tech with an Associate in Applied Science in Advertising and Graphic Design this spring.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- In my free time, I can be found loving on my zoo of pets, exploring nature through hiking, losing myself in a good book, or listening to a "relaxing" murder podcast.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have two Great Pyrenees, Oliver and Winne, two cats, Miso and Bento, a Bearded Dragon named Mushu, and a Giant African Bullfrog named David.

# About Me
## My Interests

- ðŸŽ“ I graduated from Wake Tech with an Associate in Applied Science in Advertising and Graphic Design this past spring.

- In my free time, I can be found loving on my zoo of pets, exploring nature through hiking, losing myself in a good book, or listening to a "relaxing" murder podcast.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have two Great Pyrenees, Oliver and Winnie, two cats, Miso and Bento, a Bearded Dragon named Mushu, and a Giant African Bullfrog (aka pixie frog) named David.
